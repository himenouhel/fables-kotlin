# fables
Short stories about practical solutions. Include cute animals.

Many times I tried to find minimal working solution for the problem that bothered me, but I would either get one-liner understandable only with experts in that area, or humonguous pile of code where needed parts were practically hidden.

Fables contains collection of minimal buildable projects, containing only the critical parts to solve problem at hand.
